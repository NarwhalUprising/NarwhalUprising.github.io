      <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>Interested in graph theory and combinatorics. Mentored through undergrad by <a href="https://mathdrkj.wixsite.com/home">Dr. Katie Johnson</a>. Senior research project on domination theory under the mentorship and guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/erikinskosite/">Dr. Erik Insko</a>.</p>
      <h3>Research</h3>

           Abstract: Domination theory was first introduced by Claude Berge in 1958 when considering the optimal way to build a communication network between multiple cities. Since then, domination and broadcast domination of the coordinate and isometric planes has been found, bounded and optimized. In this research project, we search for optimal domination and broadcast domination of other tilings of the plane. In addition to creating aesthetically pleasing graphs, finding optimal subpatterns of unexplored tilings will hopefully provide insight into generating subpatterns for non-regular tilings that can be directly applied to real-world domination problems, such as city planning and resource distribution.
