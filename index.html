         <p>Estefany is graduating with a Mathematics B.S. and a Secondary Math Education B.A. Her experiences include being a TA/LA for various math courses, working as a tutor at the math department's tutoring lab, participating in GEMS workshops, and completing a semester as the Teacher of Record for six high school geometry sections.  After graduation, she hopes to work as a high school teacher in high-needs schools before pursuing a graduate degree in math. </p>
         <p> Teaching Philosophy: As much as I can offer a student (support, resources, etc.), I can’t do their homework for them, and I can’t take their tests for them. So, when it comes to being available to help my students academically, I am 100% on their side, but I also have to develop their sense of responsibility, pride in their work and accomplishments, and the discipline to do their true best even in a subject they don’t like. </p>
         <p> Mathematical Philosophy: To quote the great Dr. Brian Johnson, "Math is not a spectator sport.  Just as one does not train for a marathon by watching others run, you cannot expect to master mathematical material by watching others do problems or by reading a solutions manual."</p>

          <li><a href="https://github.com/NarwhalUprising/NarwhalUprising.github.io/blob/master/Beautiful_Tiling_Domination_Poster.pdf">Beautiful Tiling Domination</a> by Estefany Narvaez Collado and Erik Insko.
           Abstract: Domination theory was first introduced by Claude Berge in 1958 when considering the optimal way to build a communication network between multiple cities. Since then, domination and broadcast domination of the coordinate and isometric planes has been found, bounded and optimized. In this research project, we search for optimal domination and broadcast domination of other tilings of the plane. In addition to creating aesthetically pleasing graphs, finding optimal subpatterns of unexplored tilings will hopefully provide insight into generating subpatterns for non-regular tilings that can be directly applied to real-world domination problems, such as city planning and resource distribution.
